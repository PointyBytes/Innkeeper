# The Innkeeper
By Egil Töllner

---

### Introduction
This book—let's be honest, it's more of a pamphlet—is aimed at game masters, writers, and anyone else interested in creating a compelling frontier setting where the classic inn serves as a hub for adventurers exploring the region. I've designed a series of prompts to help you flesh out this world in a way that feels both lived-in and steeped in history. While I can't claim to represent every perspective (as a white, middle-aged, cis-man), I've striven to be as inclusive as possible. If you think I've fallen short, please let me know; if you think I've succeeded, tell everyone!

### Foreword
I was first drawn to the world of Solo RPGs through a game called "Four Against Darkness," which piqued my interest but didn't fully satisfy my creative itch. Upon discovering journaling RPGs, I dove in headfirst, and I realized that this was the perfect platform to cut my teeth on. This brought me back to the time I was planning a campaign in the style of "West Marches"—a sandbox adventure setting—and I found myself wishing there were more resources for crafting the rich, expansive worlds these kinds of games inhabit. This is my contribution to that space.

### Basic Concepts
In this section, you'll introduce the fundamental terms that the reader will encounter throughout the book. This provides the conceptual framework that will aid in understanding the subsequent chapters.

- **West Marches**: A sandbox-style, player-driven campaign setting often featuring a large, unexplored map.
- **Nodes**: Key locations or events that serve as hubs for adventures.
- **Journaling RPG**: A role-playing game that relies heavily on written narrative, often driven by the player themselves.


### Step-by-Step Guide
