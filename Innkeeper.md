# The Innkeeper
By Egil Töllner

---

### Introduction
This book—let's be honest, it's more of a pamphlet—is aimed at game masters, writers, and anyone else interested in creating a compelling frontier setting where the classic inn serves as a hub for adventurers exploring the region. I've designed a series of prompts to help you flesh out this world in a way that feels both lived-in and steeped in history. While I can't claim to represent every perspective (as a white, middle-aged, cis-man), I've striven to be as inclusive as possible. If you think I've fallen short, please let me know; if you think I've succeeded, tell everyone!

### Foreword
I was first drawn to the world of Solo RPGs through a game called "Four Against Darkness," which piqued my interest but didn't fully satisfy my creative itch. Upon discovering journaling RPGs, I dove in headfirst, and I realized that this was the perfect platform to cut my teeth on. This brought me back to the time I was planning a campaign in the style of "West Marches"—a sandbox adventure setting—and I found myself wishing there were more resources for crafting the rich, expansive worlds these kinds of games inhabit. This is my contribution to that space.

## Main Content

### Basic Concepts
In this section, you'll introduce the fundamental terms that the reader will encounter throughout the book. This provides the conceptual framework that will aid in understanding the subsequent chapters.

- **West Marches**: A sandbox-style, player-driven campaign setting often featuring a large, unexplored map.
- **Nodes**: Key locations or events that serve as hubs for adventures.
- **Journaling RPG**: A role-playing game that relies heavily on written narrative, often driven by the player themselves.


### Step-by-Step Guide
#### Creating a Safe Zone
The inn is the only safe zone in this frontier land. Adventurers come here to hang up their swords and get out of their armor. This safe zone is their oasis where they can kick back and lick their wounds before they gear up and head out again.

- How long has this building been here?
- Did it begin its life as something else and later repurposed as an inn?
- Who runs it?
- How long have they been here?
- What is the inn's backstory? How long has it existed, and has it always been an inn?
- Who's the innkeeper? Are they originally from this area, or a newcomer who saw the business opportunity?


##### Other buildings
Is the inn the only building in the safe zone or are there other buildings here?
- Is there a blacksmith, general store, or perhaps even a hidden temple?
- How do these other buildings interact with the inn? Are they competitors or complementary?


#### Designing the Region's History
Here we will take a deep dive in the adventuring areas history.

- Was the area once the center of a grand civilization that has since fallen?

Ideas to what hapened to the area befor.

#### Node Design and Connections
In this section we will add some noteworthy sections of the adventuring area.
