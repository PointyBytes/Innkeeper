# The Innkeeper
By Egil Töllner

---

### Introduction
This book—let's be honest, it's more of a pamphlet—is aimed at game masters, writers, and anyone else interested in creating a compelling frontier setting where the classic inn serves as a hub for adventurers exploring the region. I've designed a series of prompts to help you flesh out this world in a way that feels both lived-in and steeped in history. While I can't claim to represent every perspective (as a white, middle-aged, cis-man), I've striven to be as inclusive as possible. If you think I've fallen short, please let me know; if you think I've succeeded, tell everyone!

### Foreword
I was first drawn to the world of Solo RPGs through a game called "Four Against Darkness," which piqued my interest but didn't fully satisfy my creative itch. Upon discovering journaling RPGs, I dove in headfirst, and I realized that this was the perfect platform to cut my teeth on. This brought me back to the time I was planning a campaign in the style of "West Marches"—a sandbox adventure setting—and I found myself wishing there were more resources for crafting the rich, expansive worlds these kinds of games inhabit. This is my contribution to that space.
