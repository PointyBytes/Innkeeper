# The Innkeeper
By Egil Töllner

---

### Introduction
This book—let's be candid, it's more of a hyper-focused guide—is aimed at game masters, writers, and the intrepid souls who find themselves juggling both roles. We're delving deep into creating a frontier setting where inns are not just pixelated backgrounds but lively hubs for adventurers. While I cannot represent every perspective, given my background as a white, middle-aged, cis-man, I've made a concerted effort to be as inclusive as possible. Your feedback is essential; if you think I've fallen short, please tell me; if you think I've succeeded, tell everyone!

### Foreword
When I first laid my hands on a copy of "Four Against Darkness," it was like catching a glimpse of an entirely new universe, just waiting to be explored. But it wasn't enough. Then came journaling RPGs, and I was hooked. I found myself harkening back to my plans for a "West Marches" style campaign and wished for more tools to flesh out these expansive worlds. Thus, this book was born.

But beyond this, I want this space to be one that nurtures understanding and acceptance. Mental health is an often-stigmatized topic, but here, we're challenging that stigma. You'll find prompts and discussions that might dig deep into the psyche. If you're a game master, consider discussing themes, tones, and any boundaries with your group before diving into this book. The aim here is not just inclusivity but safety and well-being for everyone at the table. In fact, don't hesitate to reach out to professionals—like your HR representative—on how to manage sensitive issues. After all, while we are crafting worlds, we're also building communities. You are never alone.

## Main Content

### Basic Concepts
In this section, you'll introduce the fundamental terms that the reader will encounter throughout the book. This provides the conceptual framework that will aid in understanding the subsequent chapters.

- **West Marches**: A sandbox-style, player-driven campaign setting often featuring a large, unexplored map.
- **Nodes**: Key locations or events that serve as hubs for adventures.
- **Journaling RPG**: A role-playing game that relies heavily on written narrative, often driven by the players themselves.


### Step-by-Step Guide

### Character Building: The Heart and Soul of Your World

> Note: The prompts for each suit of cards range from darker or more depressing topics (lower cards) to lighter or more uplifting ones (higher cards). Feel free to remove or redraw cards to match the tone you wish for your setting.

#### How to Use This Guide
- To create a well-rounded character, consider drawing at least one card from each suit.
- For a more complex character, feel free to draw multiple cards from the same suit.

#### Examples
- For a hero, focus on drawing cards from the ♥️ Hearts and ♦️ Diamonds suits.
- For a villain, you may want to concentrate on the ♠️ Spades and ♣️ Clubs suits.
- For a neutral or support character, try mixing and matching cards from all suits.
