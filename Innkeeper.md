## Table of Contents

### Introduction
My thought is that this is book (let's not kid ourselves pamflet) is for those who want to create a frontier setting with the classical inn as a hub for the adventurers who exploar the area.
I want to create a set of prompts that coaxes this area out of your imagination and spur you to write about it. My hope is that you find it useful and create the basis for your setting that seams lived in and with a history.
I dont want to expect anything from you other than you hope to create this setting. I hope to be as inclusive as I can being a white midle aged cis-man. If I fail in this please tell me, and if I do it right tell everyone.

### Foreword
I found myself looking into Solo RPGs and found journaling RPGs. Not knowing anything about it I dived in headfirst and said to myself that this is something I want to cut my teeth on and try.
I had tried Four Against Darkness but never a journaling solo rpg. Remembering how I had started to plan a West Marshes style fantasy campaign I remembered how I searshed for material like this. Creating the setting around the vast map the players are going to exploar.
